# Bumble

## Overview

This helps with swiping on bumble by automatically disliking profiles that do not meet criteria, such as too few images or questions answered. It is also easily customizable, so you could reject profiles that do not list "David Bowie" in their Spotify Artists.

It only dislikes profiles; it does not like them. If it does not determine to dislike a profile, it waits for you to manually like or dislike it.
