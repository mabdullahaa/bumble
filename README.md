# Bumble

## Overview

DISCLAIMER: This code only searches through viusible profiles, never scraping, replicating, or storing user data.

WHATüîé: This code was created to ease the process of using social discovery apps (specifically Bumble BFF)‚Äîeliminating info gaps like profiles with zero photos, no bio, and/or one-sentence bios. Please note, this code is inclusionary and should not be used for collaborative filtering. 

WHY‚ùì: As people attempt to renew and build connections post-pandemic, I've grown deeply interested in leveraging the web to form meaningful in person relationships, aligning with the undeniable proliferation of digital media like Instagram and Facebook. 
 
HOW üìú: This bot saves time by skipping Bumble BFF profiles that don't meet bare minimum* preferences. For e.g., I  find profiles w/o a bio to be much too vague for any thoughtful connection. Theoretically, through the non_match function, the bot instantaneously filters through such instances. 

However, in order to match with someone, you will **still need to swipe right**. We want to be intentional with who we swipe on and this bot is meant to enable us to grasp these **purposeful matches faster**. 

## Demo

Hopefully this is blurred enough.
