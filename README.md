# Bumble

## Overview

DISCLAIMER: This code only searches through viusible profiles, never scraping, replicating, or storing user data.

What: This code was created to ease the process of using social discovery apps. It automatically dislikes profiles with no bio, or not enough questions or images.

Why: As people attempt to renew and build connections post-pandemic, I've grown deeply interested in leveraging the web to form meaningful in person relationships, aligning with the undeniable proliferation of digital media like Instagram and Facebook. 

However, in order to match with someone, you will **still need to swipe right**. We want to be intentional with who we swipe on and this bot is meant to enable us to grasp these **purposeful matches faster**. 

## Demo

Hopefully this is blurred enough.
